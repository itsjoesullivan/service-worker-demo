# Service Worker Demo

This repo is demonstrates [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) in the most basic way that I could imagine. It uses service workers to cache a page that does nothing but display its own version.

I've included a firebase.json file here, which you could easily use to deploy this repo live and experiment with it:

1. Ensure that you have npm install firebase-tools
2. Clone this repo and navigate to it
3. firebase deploy

It should ask you to authenticate (maybe you'll need to sign up), and you will need to create an app to hang on to it.
